# Dota2 Auto Accept - 2019

## Introduction
+ Tired of missing to accept you games and getting 
thrown into LP? 
+ Is your Dota2 game on Swedish?
+ Do you have Java installed?

If yes on all this might be the solution for you! ðŸ’¥

The program works by taking a screenshot and comparing it to `dotapic.png`. If they match, it simulates a left click to accept the game. This means no game memory or mouse clicks are injected into the game.

## How to Use

1. Put `dotapic.png` in `C:\`
2. Start Main.java
3. The program can be shut off by closing the window. It will also close itself after accepting a game.
